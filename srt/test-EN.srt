1
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:17,892
What do you want to do today?

2
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,853
I don't know.

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,064
Playing house got a little boring.

4
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,607
Yeah.

5
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:29,112
I wonder when Mommy's visitors
are going to leave.

6
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,074
They should go home already.

7
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,701
I know.

8
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,335
What's that?

9
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,677
<i>I saw a doll walking down the path.</i>

10
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,639
<i>A really big doll.</i>

11
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,937
<i>She seemed like bad news for some reason.</i>

12
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,112
Mommy, Mommy!

13
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,614
Miss Ann!

14
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,950
-I see what you're saying, but...
-It's important to do.

15
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,453
-Yes, but...
-Mommy!

16
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,999
Ann! Don't I always tell you
that you have to knock first?

17
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,253
Also, a proper greeting.

18
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,425
Welcome to our home.

19
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,887
-Pardon me, Mother.
-My.

20
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,388
Very good.

21
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,141
Now, what is it?

22
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,604
Did you find another strange bug?

23
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,399
-I don't want to see it though, okay?
-It's not a bug!

24
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,777
I saw a doll walking over!

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,861
A doll?

26
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,446
Madam.

27
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,574
She's arrived.

28
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,746
Oh, that Doll! That was today, wasn't it?

29
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,581
Please show her in.

30
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,667
-Yes, madam.
-Wait a second!

31
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,961
I'm very sorry, but we'll have to
do this another time.

32
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:11,756
Wait, what are you going to do
with this mansion?

33
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:16,386
She can't live here on her own.
That's why we offered--

34
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,721
Please come back another time.

35
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,223
Wait!

36
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,067
Ann.

37
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,487
Be a good girl, okay?

38
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,617
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

39
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,871
Thank you for coming all this way.

40
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,247
It's not a problem.

41
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,207
She talks!

42
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,879
I will travel anywhere
to meet your request.

43
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,964
Auto Memory Doll--

44
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,799
I knew you were a doll!

45
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,717
Ann!

46
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,803
-I'm sorry.
-No apology necessary.

47
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,974
Violet Evergarden at your service.

48
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,395
Please, have a seat.
Would you like some tea?

49
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,069
I hope it's to your liking.

50
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,906
-Please help yourself.
-Thank you.

51
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:22,952
She's drinking!

52
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,830
-What happens to the tea you drink?
-Ann.

53
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,084
It will eventually be expelled from
my body and return to earth.

54
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,379
Ann, you're being rude.

55
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:35,965
Shall we begin?

56
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,511
I understand that I have been hired
for a seven-day period.

57
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,640
Yes, I'd like to get started right away.

58
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,141
Understood.

59
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,227
Where shall we work?

60
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,606
Well, how about we do it in the sunroom
where it's bright?

61
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:56,444
-What are you going to do?
-She's helping me write a letter.

62
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,656
I can write a letter for you!

63
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,742
You don't know how to spell
the hard words yet, Ann.

64
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,868
I can do it!

65
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:09,749
Besides, Ms. Violet is very famous
for being a very good letter writer.

66
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,543
Who is the letter to?

67
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,462
Well...

68
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,632
Someone very far away.

69
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,676
-Far away?
-Yes.

70
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,095
It's an important letter.

71
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:27,058
You're not allowed in the sunroom, okay?
Shall we, Miss Violet?

72
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,434
Understood.

73
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,651
This is the typewriter I brought.

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,653
That is fine with me.

75
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,113
Understood.

76
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,534
I knew she was bad news.

77
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,626
She really is a doll.

78
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,256
Madam!

79
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,266
Are you okay, Mommy?

80
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,393
I'm okay.

81
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,687
I'll get better in no time.

82
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,480
Really?

83
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,526
Really.

84
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,864
I know! I'll sing you a lullaby!

85
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,366
Thank you.

86
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,369
But grownups don't need lullabies.

87
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,041
Then can I sleep here with you?

88
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,417
Oh.

89
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,961
But I thought you outgrew naps.

90
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,838
I want to take one today.

91
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,968
More importantly, Ann,
would you go entertain our visitor?

92
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,137
I hate visitors.

93
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,182
They all try to take you away from me.

94
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,062
I'm sorry, Ann.

95
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,566
But please, it's just for seven days.

96
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,818
Be a good girl for me, okay?

97
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,828
My mother said she'll be
resting for a while.

98
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,663
I see.

99
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,250
She's just a little sleepy.

100
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:22,131
I'll entertain you in the meantime.

101
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,552
I hate visitors,

102
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,722
but you're a doll.

103
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,558
What are we going to do?

104
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:38,314
Well, we could talk,
or play, or something.

105
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,526
That is outside my expertise.

106
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:43,945
However,

107
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,739
if it is only for a little while...

108
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,494
-Then let's play with my doll!
-Very well.

109
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,879
A doll playing with a doll,
that's too funny!

110
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,216
What shall I do with this?

111
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,137
Talk to her, or take care of her,
obviously!

112
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,972
First, you need to say hello.

113
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,474
Hello!

114
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,144
Hello.

115
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,272
Oh, hello.

116
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,319
The doll was the one who said that!

117
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,530
I see.

118
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,490
I understand.

119
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,577
Oh, right! You're a doll,

120
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,580
so, you've never played
with one of your own!

121
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,998
No, I--

122
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,583
I'll teach you how!

123
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,544
Next, let's play house then.

124
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,463
I have a table out in the yard.

125
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,884
Excuse me, your room is ready.
I shall show you to it.

126
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,093
Thank you.

127
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,263
You will have to excuse me.

128
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,601
Your room is on the second floor.

129
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,445
I wonder what they're talking about.

130
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,451
Ellis!

131
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,954
-I'll go take that over!
-Oh! You certainly may not!

132
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,540
This is my job.

133
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,210
Please don't take it from me.

134
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,715
Why is life so unfair?

135
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,210
Yes?

136
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,962
It's Ann.

137
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,047
Please come in.

138
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,926
Is something the matter?

139
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,596
What are you doing?

140
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,057
I was adjusting my arm.

141
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,350
Adjusting?

142
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,769
Yes, so it would move properly.

143
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,605
Then are you writing letters again
tomorrow?

144
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,149
-Yes.
-And the next day?

145
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,360
-Yes.
-Seven days, so...

146
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,405
-The next day and the next?
-Yes.

147
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,615
Who are you writing it to?

148
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,076
That, I cannot say.

149
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,619
Why not?

150
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,872
-I have a duty to confidentiality.
-Confi...

151
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,376
Stop using hard words!

152
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,169
I apologize.

153
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,547
It can't be my father.

154
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,717
Because my father's gone.

155
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,052
You know that big war?

156
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,055
He died a hero.

157
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,852
So, who are you writing this letter to?

158
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,437
Miss Ann.

159
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,648
Did you come to see me for something?

160
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,525
What do you mean?

161
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:15,323
Ellis went home,
and mommy already went to bed.

162
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,746
Then, Miss Ann,
you should go to bed as well.

163
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,040
Why!?

164
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,752
Staying up late is not good for a lady.

165
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,464
That is what Ms. Cattleya said.

166
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:32,798
Who's that?

167
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,759
Another Doll at my company.

168
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,886
-Another one?
-Yes.

169
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,473
There are also other Dolls
named Miss Erica and Miss Iris.

170
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,934
Wow! There's that many living dolls?

171
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,395
Yes.

172
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,819
-Miss Ann.
-Fine! I'll go to bed!

173
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,073
You'd better get to bed, too,
or my mommy will be mad!

174
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,410
And if you stay up too late,
a ghost will come out to haunt you!

175
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,916
Good night, Miss Ann.

176
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,125
Good night!

177
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,559
What a weird doll!

178
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,984
"The thief was surprised. He yelled, 'Ah!'

179
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,320
And ran away."

180
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,282
You are quite good at reading.

181
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,285
Violet!

182
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:49,458
What kind of bread is really hard
and can't be eaten?

183
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,878
You could put it in soup to soften it.

184
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,006
Violet! Violet!

185
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,469
Until my mom comes,
let's do riddles and dance together

186
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,139
and play house and catch bugs...!

187
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,265
Miss Ann.

188
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,851
Please tell me the order of priority.

189
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,311
Violet, read me a book.

190
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,938
Violet!

191
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,356
Violet!

192
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,156
What are your thoughts?

193
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:25,202
-Yes, it's very good.
-Then I shall continue in this style.

194
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,037
Thank you.

195
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,379
-Ann!
-Oh, it's not what you think!

196
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,425
I was hoping Violet
could tie a ribbon in my hair.

197
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,053
I see, but later, okay?

198
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,849
Madam, would you allow me a short break?

199
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,100
Huh?

200
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,936
I believe Miss Ann would like it now.

201
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,524
There you are, Miss Ann.

202
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:01,322
I didn't want you to put
the ribbon in my hair.

203
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,075
-Yes.
-I really wanted my mommy to do it.

204
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,371
-Yes.
-And she's the one I want to read with...

205
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,707
and do riddles and play house...

206
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,502
Although Mommy doesn't like bugs.

207
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,714
Stop taking away my time
with my mommy, Violet!

208
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,633
It's only for a few more days.

209
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:25,513
Then tell my mommy I can be there
when you're writing your letter!

210
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,848
I just want to be near her!

211
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,560
All I want is to be close
and squeeze her hand. Please!

212
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,481
I am terribly sorry, I cannot do that.

213
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,524
Why not!?

214
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,526
I'm sorry, Miss Ann.

215
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,320
I must be getting back.

216
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:53,582
-Do you think we could finish by today?
-Yes, if we continue at this pace.

217
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,543
Madam, if you would.

218
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,170
Madam?

219
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,548
I'm okay.

220
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:04,927
Madam!

221
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,014
-I'm okay.
-But...

222
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,892
Please, continue.

223
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,520
-Stop! That's enough! Mommy!
-Miss Ann!

224
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,981
-That's enough!
-Ann.

225
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,318
I'm okay.
So, please go play in the other room.

226
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,866
Why are you writing this letter?

227
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,911
Who is it for?
Daddy isn't even with us anymore!

228
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:35,457
-It's an important letter.
-It's for someone I don't know, isn't it?

229
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,252
Someone who won't even come visit you!

230
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,506
No one really cares about you anyway!

231
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,307
Is the letter more important than me?

232
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,354
There's nothing more important than you.

233
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,399
You're such a liar.

234
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,609
I'm not lying.

235
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:09,283
But you're not getting better at all!
You said you were going to get better!

236
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,701
That's right.

237
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,286
I already know!

238
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,204
I...

239
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,791
I'll be all alone once you're gone!

240
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,505
How much longer
will I be able to be with you?

241
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,260
If I'm going to be all alone anyway,

242
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,889
then stop writing some letter
and spend time with me now!

243
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,891
Please, Mom!

244
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,309
Please!

245
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,728
-Mommy!
-Miss Ann.

246
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,480
Mommy!

247
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,486
Miss Ann!

248
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,060
Miss Ann.

249
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,188
I want to reassure you

250
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,941
that the time I am spending
with your mother is for a good cause.

251
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,654
Please, I ask you not to be angry
with your mother.

252
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,572
But...

253
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,199
But...

254
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,410
It is only natural
that this is painful for you.

255
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,665
You had to accept your mother's illness
at such a young age.

256
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,959
You are so strong.

257
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,627
I'm not!

258
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,797
I'm not...

259
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,882
I...

260
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,011
I made my mommy cry!

261
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:53,762
No.

262
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,931
You are a very kind person.

263
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,808
-I'm not.
-You are.

264
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,560
I'm not!

265
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,604
I'm not! I'm not!

266
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:07,901
-My mommy got sick because I'm a bad girl!
-Her illness is unrelated.

267
00:17:08,484 --> 00:17:11,195
It is! It is!

268
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:15,701
There is nothing...
There is nothing that can be done.

269
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,453
You're wrong.

270
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:20,329
Just as my arms...

271
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,666
can never be soft and warm like yours are.

272
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,298
There is nothing that can be done.

273
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,431
Mommy...

274
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,558
Mommy...

275
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,814
Why is she writing a letter?

276
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,525
People have feelings
they want to express to others.

277
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,444
Who cares?

278
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,198
They don't need to.

279
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:02,790
There is no such thing as a letter that
doesn't deserve to be delivered, Miss Ann.

280
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,598
<i>Then the day came</i>
<i>when the doll who embraced me</i>

281
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,185
<i>finished writing the letters</i>
<i>and it was time to say goodbye.</i>

282
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,531
Violet!

283
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,959
-Miss Ann.
-Huh?

284
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,463
You're warm.

285
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,510
Wait, are you...?

286
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,389
Then what about the tea you drank?

287
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,974
As I said,

288
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:06,145
I will eventually expel it from my body
and it will return to the earth.

289
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,821
<i>She wasn't a doll after all.</i>

290
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,116
<i>And she wasn't bad news either.</i>

291
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,994
<i>She was very kind.</i>

292
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:28,417
<i>I really wish I could have read</i>
<i>the letters she wrote.</i>

293
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,837
<i>I wonder who they were for.</i>

294
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,505
Ann.

295
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,675
Let's have some tea.

296
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,596
Let's play with my doll, Mommy.

297
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,933
-Okay.
-Then we can read books and play house...

298
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:57,988
<i>Ann.</i>

299
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,036
<i>Ann.</i>

300
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,876
<i>My Ann.</i>

301
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,648
<i>Ann.</i>

302
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,238
<i>Ann.</i>

303
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,657
<i>Happy eighth birthday.</i>

304
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,910
<i>There might be many sad things happening,</i>

305
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,205
<i>and you might be feeling</i>
<i>really overwhelmed right now.</i>

306
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,873
<i>But don't give up hope.</i>

307
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,210
<i>You might be sad and feel like crying,</i>

308
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,795
<i>but don't forget:</i>

309
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,466
<i>Your mother loves you very much.</i>

310
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,390
<i>Ann, happy tenth birthday.</i>

311
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,269
<i>I'm sure you've grown quite a lot.</i>

312
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,856
<i>But I'm sure you still love reading</i>
<i>and dancing.</i>

313
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,527
<i>Have you graduated from riddles and bugs?</i>

314
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,449
<i>Happy 18th birthday.</i>

315
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,910
<i>You're a grown woman now.</i>

316
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,663
<i>Are you in love?</i>

317
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,708
<i>I can't give you love advice,</i>

318
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:37,796
<i>but I'm sure whoever you choose</i>
<i>is a wonderful person.</i>

319
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,596
<i>Happy birthday, Ann.</i>

320
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,392
<i>You've lived for 20 years now.</i>
<i>That's amazing.</i>

321
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,855
<i>But remember that even adults</i>
<i>are allowed to complain sometimes.</i>

322
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,567
<i>Whenever you're feeling down,</i>
<i>remember that I am with you.</i>

323
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,529
<i>Ann.</i>

324
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:09,953
<i>I will always,</i>
<i>always be watching over you.</i>

325
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,975
Great work, Violet.

326
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,977
You did so many!

327
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:38,857
These letters are to be delivered
to Ann Magnolia for the next fifty years.

328
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,942
You wrote 50 letters?!

329
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,196
It was your first long trip in a while.

330
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,363
Were you okay?

331
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,825
-It was not a problem.
-But this is so great.

332
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,661
She's going to look forward
to these coming every year.

333
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,997
Yes, but...

334
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,501
by the time they arrive...

335
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,795
her mother will...

336
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,381
She's still so little.

337
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,967
She gets so lonely.

338
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,931
And Ann's mother has to leave
her precious daughter behind.

339
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,392
She'll be left all alone...

340
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,686
in that mansion.

341
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,105
I...

342
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,360
I...

343
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:27,906
I had to hold back my tears
the whole time I was at the mansion.

344
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:29,866
Yes.

345
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,119
But, Violet...

346
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,663
they will reach her.

347
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,040
The letters you wrote.

348
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,965
No matter how far away she is.

349
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,803
A LOVED ONE
WILL ALWAYS WATCH OVER YOU

350
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,018
